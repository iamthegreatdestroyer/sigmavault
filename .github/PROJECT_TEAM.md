## ESCALATION PATHS

### Critical Issues (Security/Correctness)

If any team member identifies a critical issue:

1. Notify @ARCHITECT and @CIPHER immediately
2. Create GitHub issue with CRITICAL label
3. Emergency team sync within 2 hours
4. Coordinate resolution

### Decision Conflicts

If agents disagree on approach:

1. Document both positions
2. @ARCHITECT evaluates tradeoffs
3. Final decision recorded in DECISION_LOG.md
4. Both perspectives preserved for future reference

### Scope Creep Prevention

Phase 1 is strictly scoped to foundation & validation:

- ✓ Architecture review
- ✓ Security baseline
- ✓ Code quality
- ✗ Performance optimization (Phase 3)
- ✗ Windows support (Phase 4)
- ✗ New features (post-Phase 2)

Requests outside scope escalate to @ARCHITECT for Phase 2+ planning.
